StockSlayer is a networked, multiplayer game based on the stock market.
Players buy and sell shares in a simulated market, trading alongside
several computer players. Each transaction influences the further
development of the stock price. Furthermore, companies' ratings,
and thus their share price, can be impacted by randomly occuring
events.
